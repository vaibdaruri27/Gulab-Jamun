Step 1
In a large bowl, stir the milk powder, flour, baking powder, and cardamom together. Later, stir in the almonds, pistachios and golden raisins. Stir and mix in the melted ghee, then pour the milk, and continue to mix and stir until all is blended. Cover the bowl and let it rest for 20 minutes.

Step 2
Find a large skillet and in it, stir together the sugar, water, rose water and a pinch of cardamom. Bring it to a boil point, and let it simmer for just a minute. Set it aside.

Step 3
Fill a large heavy skillet halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for 5 minutes. Knead the dough, and form the big clumped dough into 20 small balls or more, your choice. Reduce the heat of the oil to lowest temp, and fry the ball in batches. After 5 minutes, they will float, and expand to twice their real size, but the color will not change much. After the gulab-jamun floats, increase the heat to medium, and turn them frequently until light golden, and do this to how many gulab jamuns you have. Remove the gulab jamuns from the oil with something, not your hand, and allow to cool. Let it drain on something like paper towels,

Step 4
Place the balls into the half-filled with syrup skillet. Simmer the gulab-jamuns in medium heat for about 5 minutes, which will make the gulab-jamuns soak up syrup. Then serve, or chill.
